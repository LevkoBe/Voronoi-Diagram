# Voronoi Diagram Generator

üîó [**Live Demo**](https://levkobe.github.io/Voronoi-Diagram/)

An interactive, browser-based **Voronoi diagram generator** built with the Canvas API and custom geometry logic. This tool allows you to experiment with spatial partitioning in real-time, offering a fast and intuitive way to explore Voronoi tessellations using different distance metrics.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Point Editing**:

  * Add, drag, or delete seed points directly on the canvas.
  * Real-time updates with live preview on mouse move.

* **Distance Metrics**:

  * Choose between **Euclidean**, **Manhattan**, **Chebyshev**, and **Custom** distance functions.
  * Easily compare how different metrics affect the resulting tessellation.

* **High Performance Rendering**:

  * Optimized for speed and smooth interaction even with large point sets.

* **Export Support**:

  * Save the diagram as an image for use in presentations or further analysis.

## üß† Use Cases

* Visualizing spatial partitioning
* Understanding distance functions in computational geometry
* Educational demonstrations
* Generative art and design tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5 Canvas API**
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
